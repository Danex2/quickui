# QuickUI

I wanted a way for people that play World of Warcraft to be able to share their UI setups for people that may want to copy it and tweak it to their liking. Filter by class or role and see what fits you.

## Stack

Next.js  
TypeScript  
AWS Amplify  
GraphQL  
TailwindCSS

## Setup

### Installation

Install dependencies with either `yarn` or `npm`.

### Setting up amplify

You'll need to setup AWS Amplify inside of your AWS account, I recommend following the documentation for setting it up from the official docs using the [Admin UI](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/adminui/start#get-started-without-an-aws-account).

### Start up

Run the project by doing `yarn dev` and navigate to http://localhost:3000
